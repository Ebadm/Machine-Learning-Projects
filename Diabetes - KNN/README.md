### Using the diabetes dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetes-classification/data) and 
### using the train.csv dataset for both training and testing, we Perform exploratory
### data analysis and set up a KNN classifier. Find the optimal K value and Show the
### relevant performance metrics. Finally, we assess whether scaling the data improves the performance.
### Then we compare the performance of the best KNN classifier with the Naïve Bayes algorithm.

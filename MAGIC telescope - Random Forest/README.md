#### Downloading the MAGIC gamma telescope data 2004 dataset available in Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/abhinand05/magic-gamma-telescope-dataset). We Prepare the dataset and perform exploratory data analysis. 

#### We set-up a random forest algorithm for identifying whether the pattern was caused by gamma signal or not. 

#### We propose optimal values for the depth and number of trees in the random forest. 

#### Assess and compare the performance of optimized random forest with the Na√Øve Bayes algorithm & Discuss the performance metrics and the computational complexity

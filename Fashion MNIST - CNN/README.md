#### Use the Fashion MNIST dataset from the keras package. 
#### Perform exploratory data analysis. 
#### Show a random set of FIVE (5) images from each class in the dataset with their corresponding class names. 
#### Prepare the dataset by normalizing the pixel values to be between 0 and 1. 
#### Design a CNN with TWO (2) convolutional layers and FOUR (4) dense layers (including the final output layer). 
#### Employ ‘ReLU’ activation and ‘MaxPooling’. 
#### Keep 15% of the train dataset for validation. 
#### Rate the performance of the algorithm and provide necessary plots. 
#### Pick a random image from the test dataset, pass it to the algorithm and compare the algorithm output with the actual class label.

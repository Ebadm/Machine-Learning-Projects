#### Loading the wine dataset from sklearn package. We perform exploratory data analysis and
#### Design a simple TWO (2) layer neural network for the classification. 

#### For Analysis, We compare the performance with the Naïve Bayes algorithm.

#### We try to train the neural network such that it has better or same performance as that of the Naïve Bayes algorithm.

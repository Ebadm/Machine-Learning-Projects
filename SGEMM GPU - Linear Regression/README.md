### We start by understanding the dataset by performing exploratory analysis. Then, We prepare the target
### parameter by taking the average of the THREE (3) runs with long performance times.

### We design a linear regression model to estimate the target using only THREE (3) attributes
### from the dataset. 

### Finally, we discuss the results, relevant performance metrics and the impact of
### normalizing the dataset.


#### Notice that this problem was tackled in two different ways.

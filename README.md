# Machine Learning Projects
 
### Different Machine Learning Projects solved and analysed.
### Models such as, KNN, CNN, Neural networks, Decision Trees, LSTM, Random Forests, Linear Regression etc.
### Not only was a problem solved with machine learning, you can also find an analysis on the parameters and models used and comparisons.
### Finally, different ways to tackle the problem were explored.
